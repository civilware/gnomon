## WEBSOCKET

Gnomon Indexer has a built-in API / WS (websocket) component which exposes a series of methods to be consumed by alternate programs/remote systems. This outline will layout some of the many methods that are usable and their referenced parameter sets etc. which can be leveraged. Expect this documentation series to change as more methods are added or changed.
